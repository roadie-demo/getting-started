# Register New Component Template

## Outline
The template allows for quickly and efficiently registering a repository to the Roadie Backstage catalog by adding and configuring the `catalog-info.yaml` with the recommended data points necessary for the entity to be listed in the catalog, as well as enabling TechDocs. Optionally, you are able to configure additional integrations such as ArgoCD or Pager Duty.

## Inputs
1. Collect component information:
   - Name: The name of the component we are registering, this will be parsed and converted into a human readable title.
   - Description: This should be used to provided detailed information in the catalog list.
2. Collect component location:
   - Repo Host: Hardcoded and hidden, this is used in building the pull request. Alternatively, you may expose this as a select list [example below].
   - Repo Name: The name of the repository to be registered in Roadie Backstage. The list is populated through the Roadie GitHub Proxy and requires a GitHub classic API Token to be configured in your Roadie Secrets.
3. Collect integration configuration data:
   - Configuration Values: Set the integration specific information, such as App Names or Service Id's.
   - TechDocs Path: Set the directory path to be used. The Default is `docs:.`, but `url:{url}` is supported.

Repo Host Example:
```
   repoUrl:
      title: Repository Location
      type: string
      ui:field: RepoUrlPicker
      ui:options:
        allowedHosts:
          - github.com
```

## Outputs
- Creates a pull request to add the following additions to the repository:
  1. Creates the `catalog-info.yaml` file for registration in the catalog.
     - Conditionally: Enables any integrations if necessary data is provided.
  2. Creates the required files for TechDocs if `Enable TechDocs` is checked:
     - `MKDocs.yaml`: The configuration file for the repositories TechDocs.
     - `/docs/index.md`: The index page for the repositories TechDocs.
